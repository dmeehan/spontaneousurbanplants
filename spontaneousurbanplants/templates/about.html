    <p><strong>Spontaneous Urban Plants</strong> is a research project that opens up 
discourse to ecologists, artists and the general public as to the role of weeds in society, our 
perception of them and their ecological performance. By integrating principles from urban ecology and 
environmental aesthetics, we are encouraging an unbiased debate on Wild Urban Plants.</p>

<p>Large cities, culturally diverse and rich, are constantly shifting with complexities 
unmatched by other environments; anthropogenic emissions and the continual disturbance of 
the earth's surface with the constant renewal of the built environment are reason enough 
for us to reconsider the role of the weed in these disturbed, and to most other plants, 
uninhabitable sites. Artists and writers such as Andre Breton and Robert Smithson have used 
walking as a tool to appreciate urban environments. Similar to this, Allen Carlson has 
described Environmental aesthetics of engagement as the beckoning of appreciators to 
immerse themselves in the natural environment.</p>

<p>At Future Green we have been developing a similar phenomenological approach to the 
environment by inviting members of the public interact with the weeds by traversing urban 
spaces on foot and documenting their findings through social media application Instagram. 
This allows us to consider the aesthetic value of the environment from the individual.s 
perspective through immediate and hands-on experience. The <a href="{% url 'map' %}">Interactive MAP</a> 
filters photos by species or performance attributes, thus highlighting SUP's ecological, cultural, and 
aesthetic significance.</p>
